	// Usage: The instructing party has to make sure that MessageIdentification is unique per instructed party for a pre-agreed period.

	// User identification or any user key to be used to check the authority of the initiating party.
	//
	// Usage: The content is not of a technical nature, but reflects the organisational structure at the initiating side. The authorisation element can typically be used in relay scenarios, payment initiations, payment returns or payment reversals that are initiated on behalf of a party different from the initiating party.

	//
	// Usage Rule:
	// In case of amendment and cancellation request messages, the instructing agent is the party sending the amendment and cancellation request message and not the party that sent the original mandate initiation request message.
	// In case of acceptance report message, the instructing agent is the party sending the acceptance report message and not the party that sent the original mandate request message.
	InstructingAgent *BranchAndFinancialInstitutionIdentification4 `xml:"InstgAgt,omitempty"`

	// Agent that is instructed by the previous party in the chain to carry out an instruction.

	// Usage Rule:
	// In case of amendment and cancellation request messages, the instructed agent is the party receiving the amendment and cancellation request message and not the party that received the original mandate initiation request message.
	// In case of acceptance report message, the instructed agent is the party receiving the acceptance report message and not the party that received the original mandate request message.
